🏗️ The Project Roadmap
|
|

1. Data Modeling (OOP Focus)
Before writing any UI code, define your objects:

Event Object: Includes a unique ID, event name, date, and a list of ContributionSlot objects.

ContributionSlot Object: Contains a category (Main, Drink, Dessert), a status (isClaimed), 
and the name of the guest who claimed it.

|
|
|
|
|
|

2. Phase 1: The "Create & List" View (MVP)
Host View: A simple form where the host inputs the event name and selects how many slots they 
need for each category.

ID Generation: Generate a unique URL or ID (e.g., potluck.app/event/123) so the host can share
it with friends.

|
|
|
|
|

3. Phase 2: The "Claim" View (Guest Experience)
The List: When a guest opens the link, they see a list of slots.

Interaction: If a slot is "Unclaimed," the guest clicks "Claim," enters their 
name, and the app updates the state so no one else can take it.

|
|

4. Phase 3: Polish (If time permits)
Real-time Updates: Use a database that updates instantly so two people don't claim
the last "Main Course" at the same time.

Reminders: A simple button to "Copy the list" to paste back into the group chat.

🛠️ Recommended Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML/CSS and JavaScript (Keep it simple for a 2-day build).

Backend/Database: Firebase (Google). It handles "Real-time" updates perfectly 
for this specific problem and requires zero server setup.

Git Strategy: Create a main branch and a dev branch. Push your features to dev
first to ensure you don't break your "working" version right before the demo.
