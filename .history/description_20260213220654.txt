🏗️ The Project Roadmap

1. Data Modeling (OOP Focus)
Before writing any UI code, define your objects:

Event Object: Includes a unique ID, event name, date, and a list of ContributionSlot objects.

ContributionSlot Object: Contains a category (Main, Drink, Dessert), a status (isClaimed), 
and the name of the guest who claimed it.
