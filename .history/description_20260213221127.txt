🏗️ The Project Roadmap

1. Data Modeling (OOP Focus)
Before writing any UI code, define your objects:

Event Object: Includes a unique ID, event name, date, and a list of ContributionSlot objects.

ContributionSlot Object: Contains a category (Main, Drink, Dessert), a status (isClaimed), 
and the name of the guest who claimed it.




2. Phase 1: The "Create & List" View (MVP)
Host View: A simple form where the host inputs the event name and selects how many slots they 
need for each category.

ID Generation: Generate a unique URL or ID (e.g., potluck.app/event/123) so the host can share
 it with friends.
